**Mustang Virtual Showroom and Customizer**

**Section 1:** Project Description

**1.1 Project**
**Mustang Virtual Showroom and Customizer**

**1.2 Description**
This project is an interactive web application that enables users to explore and customize a 3D model of a Mustang car. Users can modify various visual elements of the car, such as color, wheels, decals, and stripes, to create their own customized version of the Mustang. The application is designed to offer an immersive and engaging experience for car enthusiasts and potential buyers.

**Section 2: Overview**

**2.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this application is to showcase a 3D interactive model of a Mustang, allowing users to view and customize the car’s appearance in real time. It aims to enhance user engagement by providing a visually appealing and user-friendly platform for customization.

**2.2 Scope**
This project will implement:

A 3D model viewer with rotation and zoom features.
Customization options for color, wheels, stripes, and decals.
A user interface displaying model details such as specifications, pricing, and features.

**2.3 Requirements**

**Functional Requirements**
FR1: Allow users to rotate and zoom the Mustang 3D model.
FR2: Provide options for customizing colors, wheels, stripes, and decals.
FR3: Display car specifications and additional information.

**Non-Functional Requirements**
Performance: Must render the 3D model smoothly without lag.
Reliability: Should load the 3D model and apply changes without errors.

**Technical Requirements**
Hardware: Compatible with standard desktops and mobile devices.
Software: Developed using JavaScript, Three.js for 3D rendering, and HTML/CSS for the UI.

**Security Requirements**
Data Privacy: No sensitive user data is required or stored.

**Section 3: System Architecture**

**3.1 Overview**
The system architecture consists of the following main components:

**Frontend (Client)**: JavaScript and Three.js are used for rendering the 3D model and implementing the customization features. HTML/CSS creates the user interface.
**3D Model Assets**: Includes the .glb file of the Mustang model and associated textures.
**Customization Logic**: JavaScript logic allows for dynamic changes to the model’s appearance based on user input.

**3.2 Architectural Diagram**
A high-level component diagram:

**User Interface (UI)**: Renders controls for customization.
**3D Rendering Engine**: Three.js, which manages model loading, rendering, and customization.
**Data Layer**: Stores temporary customization states.

**Section 4: Data Dictionary**
Table	Field	Notes	Type
Customization	color	Selected color for Mustang model	VARCHAR
Customization	wheels	Type/style of wheels selected	VARCHAR
Customization	stripes	Selected stripe design	VARCHAR
Customization	decals	Selected decals for customization	VARCHAR
Specifications	horsepower	Power output of the model	INTEGER
Specifications	engine_type	Engine type and specifications	VARCHAR

**Section 5: Data Design**

**5.1 Persistent/Static Data**
This application does not persist user data; however, customization choices are temporarily stored during a session for immediate use in rendering. Examples of static data include:

**Available Colors**: List of colors to choose from.
**Wheel Types**: Available wheel designs.
**Stripe Patterns**: Different styles of stripes.

**5.1.1 Dataset**

**Entities:**
**Customization Options:** Color, Wheels, Stripes, Decals
**Specifications:** Power, Engine Type, Price Range

**Section 6: User Interface Design**

**6.1 User Interface Design Overview**
The UI includes:
A 3D view of the Mustang model that users can rotate and zoom.
Customization controls for selecting colors, wheels, and stripe patterns.
Side panel with car specifications and customization options.

**6.2 User Interface Navigation Flow**
**Start Screen**: Load the default Mustang model.
**Customization Panel**: Users select color, wheels, stripes, or decals.
**3D Model Update**: Selections are applied to the model in real time.
**Specifications Panel**: Displays car specifications on the side.

**6.3 Use Cases / User Function Description**
**Select Color**: User chooses a color, and the model updates in real time.
**Select Wheels**: User selects wheel type, which updates on the model.
**Toggle Stripes**: User can add/remove stripes, visible on the model.

**Section 7: Testing**

**7.1 Test Plan Creation**
The testing phase will ensure:

**Rendering Quality**: 3D model renders without glitches.
**Responsiveness**: All customization options respond instantly.
**Compatibility**: Works across browsers and devices.

**Section 8: Monitoring**

**8.1 Monitoring Metrics**
This application can be monitored by tracking:

Performance Metrics: Load time, frame rate, memory usage.
User Interaction Metrics: Time spent customizing, customization frequency.

**Section 9: Other Interfaces**
This application doesn’t directly interface with external APIs but could potentially integrate with a back-end system to save and retrieve user configurations if extended in the future.

**Section 10: Extra Design Features / Outstanding Issues**
**Feature Extension**: Optionally add more customization options such as spoilers or interior details.
**Performance Optimization**: Further optimizations may be required for mobile compatibility.
